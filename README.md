# Bulldozer Sales Price Prediction â€“ Time-series Regression Project

In the following time-series project, a dataset of more than 412,000 bulldozers has been processed and modeled, employing Random Forest Regressor to predict their sale prices.

The data is sourced from the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview).

This project includes the following sections:

* Data understanding and exploration
* Parsing dates
* Feature engineering
* Data processing and imputing
* Modelling
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Model evaluation
* Feature importance
